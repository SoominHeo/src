Guangdong Province in southern China is one of the most densely populated regions in the world.

More than 1,300 people per square kilometer live around the Zhujiang River (Pearl River) Delta.

It is also one of China’s three largest producers of poultry.

The population of domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs exceeds more than 0.7 billion.

It is natural that people there have physical contact with birds more often than anywhere else in the world.

In crowded traditional markets, germs and other disease-causing organisms are exchanged between people and animals.



The H5N1 virus, which in recent days has continued to spread in Korea, was first detected in a goose in Guangdong in 1996.

In the fall of the following year, H5N1 spread like wildfire through local poultry farms and markets in neighboring Hong Kong.

Lee Jae-dam, dean of Ulsan University Medical College, explained: “From a genetic perspective humans, birds and cows are animals that are far apart from each other.There exists a high species barrier between the two.”

They account for 75 percent of 1,700 infectious diseases that can be spread to humans.

Kim Hyung-rae of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, “Pathogenic organisms need long-term contact and [high concentration] to jump the species barrier.”
