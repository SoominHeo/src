Martin Carhill, known as the thief of the century, was born in 1949 in Dublin, the capital of Ireland.

He had special skills of robbery techniques seemingly beyond human power and broke new ground in the science of theft.

He opened the vault of a bank as if it was his own safe.

When he felt that the process of his trial seemed unfavorable, he broke into the courthouse and stole records and evidence for the trial.

He once robbed an entire art museum.

Until he was shot by an unidentified man and died at the age of 45, his robberies netted him some $60 million, and that was only the amount officially confirmed by the police.

Although the police formed a special task force to keep a close watch on him 24 hours a day, they never stopped him.

In 1998, Irish director John Boorman made a movie, "The General," based on the life of Mr. Carhill.

The movie title came from Mr. Carhill's nickname.

Mr. Carhill, who became financially well-to-do as a result of his larceny, occasionally stole and gave a toy to a child.

But Scholars reported that about five percent of kleptomaniacs become professional robbers in real life.



The public paid a great deal of attention to the motives of Cho Se-hyung's crime in Japan.
