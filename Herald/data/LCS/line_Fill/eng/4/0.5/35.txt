Seoul National University is making bold moves to enhance its tenure evaluation system in order to make faculty members more competitive.

The tenure evaluation committee has two members from foreign universities as well as faculty members.

This serves two purposes: to apply international standards, and to ensure that professors cannot take advantage of personal networks.



SNU feels that faculty members need to be competitive in order for the university to be internationally competitive.

Moreover, as SNU has declared intentions of hiring 100 non-Korean professors, it believes that applying international standards to professor evaluations is only sensible.

Last year, the Korean Advanced Institute for Science and Technology rejected the tenure applications of 15 professors.
