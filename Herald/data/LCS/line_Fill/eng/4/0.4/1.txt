My family got together over the Chuseok holiday table. 

A son of a relative graduated from college three years ago but hadnâ€™t found a job. 

Since the Park Geun-hye administration took office in 2013, the economy has been steadily declining, and the lives of average citizens have worsened. 

In surveys, four or five respondents out of 10 have said that their financial situations were worse than the previous year. 

The government expanded the unemployment budget from 10 trillion won ($8.95 billion) in 2012 to 15 trillion won this year, but the unemployment rate of Koreans ages 15 to 29 is constantly rising. 

In 2012, it was 7.4 percent, but this February, it reached a record-high 12.5 percent.



During the 14 quarters of the Park administration, the actual GDP grew by more than 1 percent from the previous year only three times. 

However, most experts say that it is a temporary increase due to two additional working days. 

Exports in the first 10 days of September fell 3.6 percent compared to last year. 

Moreover, household debt rose to a historic high of 1,257 trillion won in the second quarter.
