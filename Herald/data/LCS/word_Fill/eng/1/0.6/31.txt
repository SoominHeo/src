Korea has had one of the lowest birth rates in the world for 15 years with less than 1.3 children per woman on average.

Starting in August, Toyota Motor will allow  around 25,000 employees, or 35 percent of the workforce at its headquarters in Japan, to work from home.

The option is available to non-manufacturing employees in human resources, research and development, accounts or sales and other engineering fields who have been with the company for more than five years.

Those working from home only have to come to the office for two hours a week.

It was responding to the governmentâ€™s aggressive agenda to maintain a population of 100 million by encouraging females to continue working and more men to help out at home.

We must not watch the changes in Japan simply with envy.

Our society needs action just as bold to push the birth rate past 1.5 by 2020.

Private corporations should also learn from Toyota and change their rigid systems.
