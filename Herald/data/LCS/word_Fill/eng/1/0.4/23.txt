Four years ago in April, 2012, Mr. Kim, a Korean national living in Canada, flew to Vancouver from Edmonton — farther than from Seoul to Beijing — to vote in the Korean general election.

If a voter had to spend extra money for the trip, as in the case of Kim, one vote could cost as much as 1 million won.

In contrast, the expense for one vote in Korea for a general election is 12,473 won.

During the last general election, only 56,000 out of 2.23 million eligible voters overseas — or 2.5 percent — cast ballots.

After the overseas voting period started on March 30, many such cases were seen once again.

On April 2, six voters, including three monks, arrived together at the Korean Embassy in India.

They were residents of Dharamshala, the home of the Dalai Lama, and they traveled more than 400 kilometers (249 miles) in 11 hours to cast their ballots.

And yet, many residents need to fly to reach voting stations in large countries such as the United States and Brazil.

To change the overseas voting system, which can cost 1 million won per vote, the ruling and opposition parties must end their fight and make efforts to raise turnout.

That is the least they can do to serve the 7 million Koreans living overseas, who are determined to make contributions to their homeland.
