It is shocking that an online columnist who identified himself as “Minerva” turned out to be a 31-year-old unemployed man whose surname is Park, according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors intend to charge Park because of just one of over 100 postings he made online.

However, the significance of this case is not limited to the simple punishment of one person.

In that respect, the Democratic Party’s intention to form a group of inspectors to develop the Minerva case into a political issue is not desirable.

In a survey by a media research firm, Real Meter, in December, 62.3 percent of respondents said they agree with the cyber defamation law.
