A court has rejected an arrest warrant for Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, citing a lack of evidence for his alleged 50 billion won ($45.5 million) embezzlement and 125 billion won breach of trust charges.

The court’s decision means that prosecutors stopped short of convincing judges of the justification for his arrest on jurisprudential grounds.



Following earlier fumbles with the investigation of Posco last year, prosecutors have once again failed to obtain an arrest warrant for Chairman Shin despite their boisterous move to bring him to justice.

Before embarking on a massive search and seizure of voluminous documents and hard drives of Lotte affiliates in June, the prosecution said it had strong suspicions on their alleged creation of a 300 billion won slush fund.

In the meantime, Lotte Group should not regard the court’s decision as immunity for Chairman Shin’s suspicions.

In the process of the investigation, the fifth largest conglomerate’s non-transparent governance structure was laid bare.

Shin’s elder brother and Chairman of SDJ Corporation Shin Dong-joo received over 40 billion won in pay in the last 10 years while doing nothing.

Lotte must renovate itself to become a more transparent business group.

In particular, it must reestablish its own identity after throwing public doubt on its identity as a Japanese company.
