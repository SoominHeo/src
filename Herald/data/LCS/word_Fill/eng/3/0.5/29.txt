As deliberations over President Lee Myung-bak’s offer to seek renegotiation of the contentious investor-state dispute settlement (ISD) clause continued this week, the Democratic Party agreed to accept the deal if it sees a signed agreement from senior officials of the two countries that they will start talks to nullify the ISD clause.

There is only one reason why the DP is making such an unreasonable demand: It needs to form a coalition with the splinter opposition camp to win next year’s legislative and presidential elections.

The government and ruling Grand National Party have so far acted wisely, with Lee even visiting the National Assembly in an attempt to persuade the opposition in person.

Meanwhile, Japan is seeking a similar deal with the U.S.
