Four travelers got together and made one wish each.

The first traveler said he wished to become the governor of Yangzhou Province.

Then the last traveler said, “I wish to become the governor of Yangzhou Province, ride on a crane and fly to heaven with gold in my pocket.”

That’s how the expression “Yangzhou Crane” became a synonym for human greed.

Chinese poet Su Dongpo lamented in his poem “Green Bamboo House” that “if one could enjoy wealth and honor and become immortal as well, we wouldn’t say the Yangzhou Crane is greedy.”

The history of the city of Yangzhou goes back 2,500 years.

Originally, Yangzhou was a riverside village with willow trees.

Ancient documents portray Yangzhou as a “city of willows.”

Yangzhou was the south gateway at the Grand Canal that connects the Yellow River in the north and the Chang River in the south.

Yangzhou was also the center of Southern Chinese civilization and the gateway to the world.

During the Tang Dynasty, over 5,000 foreign merchants from Silla, Arabia and Europe lived there.

The Chang River is also called the Yangtze River after the famous Yangtze Bridge in Yangzhou and Westerners mistook the name of the bridge as the name of the river.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-il recently visited Yangzhou.

He made the long journey by train and met with former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who was born here, 20 years after his father Kim Il Sung met Jiang in Yangzhou.

But hopefully his trip provided him with a chance to learn from the story of the Yangzhou Crane and break the illusion that he, too, can have it all.
