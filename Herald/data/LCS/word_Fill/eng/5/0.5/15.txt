On the evening of March 24, 1882, physician and microbiologist Robert Koch stood before some 100 scientists and scholars at the Physiological Society of Berlin and gave a presentation that included a detailed description of mankind’s most vicious enemy: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 

In celebration of his achievements, March 24 is designated as World Tuberculosis Day.



Tuberculosis is one of the oldest diseases in the history of humanity. 

Signs of tuberculosis can be found in the Stone Age skulls from 5,000 B.C. discovered in Heidelberg, Germany. 

Tuberculosis decay was also found in Egyptian mummies from 3,000 B.C. 

Tuberculosis spread all over Europe from the 18th to 19th century, killing 25 percent of the population. 

D.H. Lawrence, a tuberculosis victim, wrote in his novel “Ship of Death”: “Piecemeal the body dies, and the timid soul has her footing washed away, as the dark flood rises.” 

Absurdly enough, Korea has the highest tuberculosis outbreak and death rate among the members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. 

One of the causes is the compromised immunity of young people, who are stressed about college admissions, and their diet.
