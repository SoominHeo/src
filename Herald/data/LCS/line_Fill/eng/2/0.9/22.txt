Starting with last Friday’s walkout by the Korean Financial Industry Union, Hyundai Motor on Monday staged a general strike, which will be followed by public sector unions, including railways and hospitals, today.

Jobless rates for young people has reached as high as 10 percent, while the number of the long-term unemployed — those without jobs for more than six months — hit a record high last month.

The Korean Railway Workers’ Union embarks on a strike at 9 am today.
