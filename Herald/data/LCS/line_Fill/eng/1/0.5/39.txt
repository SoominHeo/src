Martin Carhill, known as the thief of the century, was born in 1949 in Dublin, the capital of Ireland.

Although the police formed a special task force to keep a close watch on him 24 hours a day, they never stopped him.

In 1998, Irish director John Boorman made a movie, "The General," based on the life of Mr. Carhill.

The movie title came from Mr. Carhill's nickname.

Mr. Carhill, who became financially well-to-do as a result of his larceny, occasionally stole and gave a toy to a child.

But Scholars reported that about five percent of kleptomaniacs become professional robbers in real life.

The public paid a great deal of attention to the motives of Cho Se-hyung's crime in Japan.
