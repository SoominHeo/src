Last yearâ€™s survey of 4,107 first graders in elementary schools in Goyang found one in  four children displayed symptoms of behavioral problems.

These problems often go unnoticed among children from poor backgrounds, which is what prompted Goyang to offer free medical assistance to 62 children out of the 993 diagnosed with ADHD whose parents agreed to the treatment.
