Seoul National University is making bold moves to enhance its tenure evaluation system in order to make faculty members more competitive.

In the spring term this year, many of its professors did not make tenure for the first time since the founding of the school, shocking the entire university.

The tenure evaluation committee has two members from foreign universities as well as faculty members.

This serves two purposes: to apply international standards, and to ensure that professors cannot take advantage of personal networks.



SNU feels that faculty members need to be competitive in order for the university to be internationally competitive.

For example, half of Harvard University’s professors don’t make tenure.

Moreover, as SNU has declared intentions of hiring 100 non-Korean professors, it believes that applying international standards to professor evaluations is only sensible.

Last year, the Korean Advanced Institute for Science and Technology rejected the tenure applications of 15 professors.
