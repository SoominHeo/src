The two have since tossed and turned in contests over party leadership.

Born into a poor rural family, Tanaka was a self-built entrepreneur who dropped out of middle school.

Tanaka dismissed Fukuda as a man of little ability while the latter sneered at the former as ignorant and unsophisticated.

The two have long left this world, but their battle continues among their political descendants.

The Tanaka faction broke away from the LDP, with its latest heir, Ichiro Ozawa, wielding power over the main opposition Democratic Party until earlier this year.

Tanakaâ€™s daughter Makiko and Yasuo Fukuda served as the foreign minister and chief cabinet secretary, respectively, in the Koizumi cabinet, wrangling over every possible political issue.

The relationship between longtime political rivals here ?? former presidents Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung ?? has been no less bitter, interwoven and contentious.

We sincerely wish to see Kim Dae-jung regain health and to see the two Kims clasp hands to finally seal the generation of animosity and feud in modern Korean political history.
