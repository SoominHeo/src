Here is an example of that I mean: the story of Fudai, a village that survived the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. 

The small fishing village of about 3,000 residents had no victims despite the disaster that took many lives in neighboring cities. 

It was possible because of the “obvious” comment made by the village’s late mayor, Kotaku Wamura, about a half-century ago.

The highest wall then existing near the village was 10 meters high. 

Many laughed at Wamura’s project, comparing it to the Great Wall of China. 

He said that 15-meter-high waves once destroyed the village during the Meiji era. 

Because we in Korea didn’t have such obvious thoughts, the deadly collapse of the gymnasium in the Mauna Ocean Resort in Gyeongju was once again a tale of fixing the barn after losing all the cattle.

A few days before the tragedy, the Ministry of Education sent official letters to universities to warn them about the weather. 

The ministry discussed the heavy snow warning for Gangwon and North Gyeongsang provinces, advising people to remove snow and adhere to safety measures for roofs built with pre-engineered sandwich panels. 

It is easy to think that you will just build a 30-meter-high floodgate and forget about the tsunami. 

Heated roofs would clearly be a waste for Gyeongju, which rarely gets snow. 

It is not about Gyeongju or snow.
