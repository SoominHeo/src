Starting in August, Toyota Motor will allow  around 25,000 employees, or 35 percent of the workforce at its headquarters in Japan, to work from home.

This radical experiment can have strong implications for our society with its similar demographic challenge.

The option is available to non-manufacturing employees in human resources, research and development, accounts or sales and other engineering fields who have been with the company for more than five years.

Those working from home only have to come to the office for two hours a week.

We must not watch the changes in Japan simply with envy.

Our society needs action just as bold to push the birth rate past 1.5 by 2020.

The government must employ flexible work systems at public institutions to set an example.

Private corporations should also learn from Toyota and change their rigid systems.
