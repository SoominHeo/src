Four years ago in April, 2012, Mr. Kim, a Korean national living in Canada, flew to Vancouver from Edmonton — farther than from Seoul to Beijing — to vote in the Korean general election.

If a voter had to spend extra money for the trip, as in the case of Kim, one vote could cost as much as 1 million won.

That is the least they can do to serve the 7 million Koreans living overseas, who are determined to make contributions to their homeland.
