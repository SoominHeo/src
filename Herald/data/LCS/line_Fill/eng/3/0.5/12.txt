Becoming a homeowner was the lifelong dream for the post-war baby boomer generation in Japan. 

They were born in the devastation of World War II defeat between 1947 and 1949. 

There are 8 million people in the so-called Dankai generation, and they attained their dreams as they led the rapid development in the 60s and 70s. 

The Dankai generation’s ideal life was a single house with a backyard. 

They said that home is made of a house and a yard. 

The living space in the nature was the refuge after long commute to the city. 

86.2 percent of the Dankai generation were homeowners, according to the 2013 Aging Society White Paper. 

When the mortality rate of the Dankai generation goes up in 2020, additional 200,000 to 300,000 houses will become empty. 

The Nomura Research Institute predicted that 30.4 percent of the houses would become empty by 2033. 

Since half of Japan’s population live in the greater metropolitan areas of the three largest cities, every other house will become empty in other regions. 

The Japanese government and local governments are presenting various plans along with low birth and aging population policies.
