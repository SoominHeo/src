At the second Global Health Security Agenda Forum in Seoul on Sept. 7, the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s head of public health policy Kwon Jun-wook explained the MERS outbreak in Korea as the second speaker.

He was speaking to over 200 high-level health and security officials from 46 countries, experts from international organizations, including the World Health Organization, and domestic and foreign press.

Kwon had been overseeing the MERS response since late May.



“Frequent international exchanges have made contagious diseases able to spread anywhere in the world in 24 hours,” said Kwon.

A foreign reporter at the forum cynically joked, “I wanted to find out what the Korean government learned from the MERS crisis, but it seems like there never was a crisis.”

Korea had the second-largest MERS outbreak in the world, and it was the most serious among countries with no wild camels.

Since the first patient was diagnosed on May 20, 186 have been diagnosed with MERS, and 36 of them died.

Eight patients are still hospitalized with the deadly virus.

The government hasn’t declared the MERS crisis over.

We can’t laugh off the government official’s tale of heroism.



Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), attended the forum and met with reporters.

Korean government officials need to think about what makes the CDC the most trusted government agency by Americans.
