In 16th century England, a despicable person was referred to as a cat.

The general public became familiar with the phrase copycat crime after the release of the Hollywood thriller “Copycat” in 1995.

In March, then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs criticized products by Samsung, Google and Motorola as copycats while presenting the new iPad model.

Nevertheless, Professor Oded Shenkar of Ohio State University argues that imitation is not necessarily a bad management strategy.

Shenkar claims that even Jobs copied the graphic user interface and mouse he had seen at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center to create the Apple Lisa, a predecessor to the Macintosh, in the early 1980s.

And as Pablo Picasso once said: “Good artists copy; great artists steal.”
