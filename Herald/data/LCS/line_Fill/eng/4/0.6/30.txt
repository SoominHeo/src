The history of the city of Yangzhou goes back 2,500 years.

Yangzhou was the south gateway at the Grand Canal that connects the Yellow River in the north and the Chang River in the south.

Yangzhou was also the center of Southern Chinese civilization and the gateway to the world.

During the Tang Dynasty, over 5,000 foreign merchants from Silla, Arabia and Europe lived there.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-il recently visited Yangzhou.
