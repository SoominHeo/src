There are 8 million people in the so-called Dankai generation, and they attained their dreams as they led the rapid development in the 60s and 70s. 

The Dankai generation’s ideal life was a single house with a backyard. 

When the mortality rate of the Dankai generation goes up in 2020, additional 200,000 to 300,000 houses will become empty. 

The Japanese government and local governments are presenting various plans along with low birth and aging population policies. 

As Korea’s population trend is similar to Japan’s, the rate could increase drastically.
