Former President Roh Moo-hyun came to Seoul seven months after he left office and had a lot to say. 

In an event commemorating the first anniversary of the inter-Korean summit meeting, he criticized the incumbent administration’s North Korea policy, U.S. policy in general and investigations into communist activities. 

As for North Korea’s nuclear development, the definition of the Korean War and the people’s historical view, he promoted his progressive perspective. 

Former French President Charles de Gaulle returned to his hometown and wrote patriotic memoirs. 

Former President Kim Young-sam left office in the midst of the financial crisis and retired, rarely venturing into the public eye. 

But he overlooked North Korea’s aggressive acts against South Korea, the reason for the U.S. military’s presence here.
