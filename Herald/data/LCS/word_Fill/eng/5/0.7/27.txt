Leading presidential hopefuls Park Geun-hye of the Saenuri Party and Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party  have all pledged to overhaul the now-rudderless prosecution which has become riddled with power struggles, cases of corruption and sex scandals.

Park and Moon both suggested eliminating the agencyâ€™s elite central investigation unit that has been handling politically sensitive cases for the last 30 years.

As the two candidates have proposed, the investigative authority should be more fairly apportioned, and appointments, investigations and indictments made more transparent.
