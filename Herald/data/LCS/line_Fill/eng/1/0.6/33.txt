 Goyang, Gyeonggi, has taken the laudable initiative of addressing the growing number of children suffering from developmental problems by offering free examinations and treatment for the underserved.

Last yearâ€™s survey of 4,107 first graders in elementary schools in Goyang found one in  four children displayed symptoms of behavioral problems.

A nationwide survey by the government in 2006 on 94 elementary schools in 12 cities produced similar results.

These problems often go unnoticed among children from poor backgrounds, which is what prompted Goyang to offer free medical assistance to 62 children out of the 993 diagnosed with ADHD whose parents agreed to the treatment.
