Akira Haraguchi holds the world record, as he successfully recited the value of ?

to 100,000 decimal places in 16 hours last year.

In general, the approximation 3.14 is used at school.

For example, you would multiply 3.14 by the square of the radius to calculate the area of a circle.

However, in many Japanese elementary schools, 3 is substituted for the value of ?.

 When criticized, the ministry argues that, after all, the number is an approximation whether it is 3.14 or 3, and the important part is to accuately teach the concept of the ratio of a circleâ€™s circumference to its diameter.

Because of the so-called pressure-free education, the approximation of ?became 3.

The textbooks have become thinner, and the class hours been reduced to 70 percent of what they used to be.

The relaxed education was welcomed at first, but today, it is criticized as responsible for the overall deterioration of scholastic abilities.

In an academic achievement survey by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development member countries in 2004, Japanese students were rated as mediocre.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering abolishing the  pressure-free education, saying that emphasizing a relaxed environment made students neglect academics.

Unlike Japanese students, Koreans students are studying too hard.
