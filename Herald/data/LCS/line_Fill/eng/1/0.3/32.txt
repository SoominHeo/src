Political rivals have always existed and added color to world history books, but it’s not often that we see rivalries as scandalous, bitter and long-lasting as the one between former Japanese prime ministers Kakuei Tanaka and Takeo Fukuda.

The Japanese press dubbed their rivalry as the “Kaku-Fuku war.”

The power struggle between the two heir-apparent politicians of the Liberal Democrat Party kicked off when Tanaka beat Fukuda in becoming prime minister in 1972.

Born into a poor rural family, Tanaka was a self-built entrepreneur who dropped out of middle school.

The two rarely spoke in public, but pooh-poohed one another in private.

Tanaka dismissed Fukuda as a man of little ability while the latter sneered at the former as ignorant and unsophisticated.

The two have long left this world, but their battle continues among their political descendants.

The Tanaka faction broke away from the LDP, with its latest heir, Ichiro Ozawa, wielding power over the main opposition Democratic Party until earlier this year.

Tanaka’s daughter Makiko and Yasuo Fukuda served as the foreign minister and chief cabinet secretary, respectively, in the Koizumi cabinet, wrangling over every possible political issue.

The relationship between longtime political rivals here ?? former presidents Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung ?? has been no less bitter, interwoven and contentious.

We sincerely wish to see Kim Dae-jung regain health and to see the two Kims clasp hands to finally seal the generation of animosity and feud in modern Korean political history.
