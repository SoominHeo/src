Guangdong Province in southern China is one of the most densely populated regions in the world.

It is also one of China’s three largest producers of poultry.

The population of domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs exceeds more than 0.7 billion.

The H5N1 virus, which in recent days has continued to spread in Korea, was first detected in a goose in Guangdong in 1996.

They account for 75 percent of 1,700 infectious diseases that can be spread to humans.

Kim Hyung-rae of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, “Pathogenic organisms need long-term contact and [high concentration] to jump the species barrier.”
