The controversy over the rigged primaries in the opposition United Progressive Party has entered a new phase after its National Committee decided to recommend that not only party leaders but also 14 elected proportional representatives and candidates for the April 11 legislative election step down and take full responsibility for the nomination fraud.

If the 14 members bow out, only six outsiders who didn’t participate in the primary will be left.

The recommendation has yet to pass in the party’s Central Steering Committee meeting on May 12.

The UPP obtained six proportional representative seats with more than 10 percent of the votes for the party.

To meet such expectations, however, the party should display a morality and dignity befitting its new strength as a political party with 13 seats in the Assembly.

If the UPP continues to deny what the fact-finding committee found, it shows contempt for the voters and inflexible adherence to its old image as an amateurish “ideology-based party,” not an official one running on taxpayer funds.
