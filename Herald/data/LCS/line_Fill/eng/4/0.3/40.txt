Exactly 15 years ago, a reporter wrote a short article for his newspaper and had to deal with a lot of dispute and protest.

His article cited an academic paper that surveyed 1,316 adult men and women and concluded that 23 percent of the husbands had been assaulted by their wives to various degrees in the previous year.

At the time, the rate of domestic violence against wives was 31 percent.

 But the common view does not hold true for the results of the National Family Violence Survey, which was taken in 1975 and 1985 in the United States.

In both surveys, the rates of violence for men and women were similar, at 49 percent for men and 51 percent for women.

The ratio of men and women using deadly violence was 7 to 3.
